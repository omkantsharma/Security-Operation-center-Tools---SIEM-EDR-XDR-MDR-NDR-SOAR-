PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE ______.  


🔐 1. JIRA (Security Integration Tool)
One-liner: Used to track security incidents, vulnerabilities, and compliance tasks via tickets.
Example: A vulnerability scan from Tenable finds a critical flaw — JIRA auto-creates a ticket and assigns it to the security engineer.

📊 2. ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
One-liner: Collects, stores, and visualizes logs for threat detection and analysis.
Example: A brute-force login attempt generates logs that ELK displays in Kibana, triggering a JIRA alert for investigation.

🛡️ 3. Wazuh
One-liner: An open-source SIEM that detects threats through log analysis and system monitoring.
Example: Wazuh detects unauthorized file changes on a server and sends an alert to JIRA via API.

🌐 4. Zscaler
One-liner: Cloud-based security that provides safe internet access and enforces zero-trust policies.
Example: A remote employee connects to the internet — Zscaler inspects traffic, blocks malware, and logs the event for audit.

🔁 5. Proxy
One-liner: Acts as a gateway between users and the internet to filter content and protect identities.
Example: A company proxy blocks access to malicious websites and logs user activity for review.

🤖 6. SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)
One-liner: Automates security workflows and integrates tools for faster incident response.
Example: When a phishing email is reported, SOAR auto-checks reputation, isolates the endpoint, and opens a JIRA ticket — all without human action.

🌐 7. XDR (Extended Detection and Response)
One-liner: A unified platform that detects and responds to threats across endpoints, networks, and cloud.
Example: XDR identifies a suspicious file download on an endpoint, correlates it with lateral movement, and blocks the attack across systems.

Vectra L uses AI-driven network detection and response (NDR) to identify hidden threats and attacker behaviors in real time.
Example: Vectra detects lateral movement in your internal network by spotting unusual account activity and sends an alert for SOC review.

Let me know if you want a comparison with tools like Darktrace or Microsoft Defender XDR.

🕵️‍♂️ Stealthbits
One-liner: Stealthbits helps secure sensitive data and manage user access by detecting insider threats, auditing file activity, and protecting Active Directory.
Example: If a user suddenly accesses hundreds of confidential files, Stealthbits logs the behavior, alerts the security team, and can trigger a JIRA ticket via integration.

🌐 Cisco (Cybersecurity)
One-liner: Cisco provides comprehensive network security solutions including firewalls, intrusion prevention, secure access, and threat intelligence to protect enterprise networks.
Example: Cisco Firepower detects and blocks a malware attack at the network perimeter while logging the event for incident response teams.

☂️ Cisco Umbrella
One-liner: Cisco Umbrella is a cloud-delivered security platform that provides DNS-layer protection to block malicious domains and prevent phishing and malware infections before they reach your network.
Example: When a user tries to visit a known phishing site, Umbrella blocks the DNS request and prevents the connection, keeping the network safe.

One-liner: DNS translates human-readable domain names (like example.com) into IP addresses, and in cybersecurity, DNS filtering blocks access to malicious sites by preventing harmful DNS queries.
Example: A DNS firewall blocks a request to a command-and-control server domain, stopping malware from communicating with attackers.

🌐 DNS Server
One-liner: A DNS server resolves domain names into IP addresses, and secure DNS servers help prevent attacks by filtering malicious domains and ensuring reliable, trusted name resolution.
Example: A corporate DNS server blocks access to phishing domains by refusing to resolve their names, protecting users from harmful websites.

1. Endpoint (Client Device in India)
Your computer/mobile (endpoint) initiates a request by typing a URL (e.g., www.example.com).

The device’s TCP/IP stack prepares a packet with the destination IP (once resolved).

2. DNS Resolution (Domain Name to IP Address)
The endpoint sends a DNS query (UDP packet) to a configured DNS server (often ISP’s recursive DNS).

The DNS server either resolves the IP from its cache or queries root, TLD, and authoritative DNS servers to get the website’s IP.

The resolved IP is sent back to the endpoint.

3. Local Network (Switch and Router)
The endpoint forwards the HTTP request to its default gateway — typically a local router (home/office router).

Before reaching the router, packets traverse the local Ethernet/Wi-Fi switch that directs traffic within the LAN.

The router performs NAT (Network Address Translation) and forwards the packet out to the ISP.

4. ISP Network and Multiple Routers (Hops)
The packet travels through multiple ISP routers — each router is a network hop forwarding packets based on IP routing tables.

Each hop performs routing decisions, TTL decrement, and forwards the packet closer to the destination.

5. International Backbone (Undersea Cables and Transit Providers)
From India, the packet traverses undersea fiber optic cables to reach the USA — crossing multiple Autonomous Systems (AS).

Each AS’s border routers handle packet forwarding between networks.

6. Destination ISP and Local Network in USA
The packet reaches the destination ISP’s network in America.

It travels through regional routers and switches inside the data center network.

7. Final Server (Web Server in America)
The packet arrives at the web server’s network interface.

The server responds with the requested content, sending packets back via the reverse path.

Technical Flow Summary:
Step	Component	Function/Role
1	Endpoint	Sends DNS query & HTTP request
2	DNS Server	Resolves domain to IP address
3	Switch (Local LAN)	Forwards frames within local network
4	Router (Gateway)	Routes packets outside local network (NAT applied)
5	ISP Routers (Hops)	Forward packet via multiple hops across networks
6	Undersea Cables	Physical link connecting continents
7	Destination ISP	Routes packet towards data center
8	Data Center Switch	Forwards packet inside data center
9	Server	Processes request and sends response


Cisco Umbrella is a cloud-based DNS security service that blocks users from accessing malicious websites by filtering DNS requests before a connection is made.
Example: When an employee tries to visit a phishing site, Umbrella blocks the DNS request, preventing access and protecting the network.

Cortex XDR is an extended detection and response platform by Palo Alto Networks that integrates endpoint, network, and cloud data to detect, investigate, and respond to advanced cyber threats.
Example: Cortex XDR detects unusual endpoint behavior indicating a ransomware attack, automatically isolates the device, and alerts the security team for rapid response.

WildFire is Palo Alto Networks’ cloud-based threat analysis service that detects and blocks unknown malware by running suspicious files in a sandbox environment.
Example: When a user downloads a suspicious email attachment, WildFire analyzes it in the cloud and blocks it if found malicious, preventing infection.


Microsoft ATP (Advanced Threat Protection) is a security platform that helps detect, investigate, and respond to advanced cyber threats across endpoints, emails, and identities.
Example: MS ATP identifies a phishing email with a malicious link, quarantines it, and alerts the security team to prevent compromise.

MITRE ATT&CK lists adversary tactics like Initial Access, Execution, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion, Credential Access, Discovery, Lateral Movement, Collection, Exfiltration, and Impact.
Example: An attack using PowerShell for remote execution maps to the "Execution" tactic in the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

The Cyber Kill Chain is a security model developed by Lockheed Martin that outlines the stages of a cyberattack, from reconnaissance to data exfiltration and impact.
Example: A phishing email with a malicious link represents the "Delivery" stage in the Cyber Kill Chain.
----------------------------------
🔐 Kill Chain Stages (in one line each):
Reconnaissance – Attacker gathers information about the target.

Weaponization – Creates malware or payloads based on the collected data.

Delivery – Sends the payload via email, web, or USB.

Exploitation – Executes the malware on the victim's system.

Installation – Installs a backdoor or remote access tool (RAT).

Command and Control (C2) – Establishes communication with attacker’s server.

Actions on Objectives – Performs the intended goal: stealing data, disrupting systems, etc.
