EDR typically stands for Endpoint Detection and Response, 
a cybersecurity technology focused on detecting, investigating, 
and responding to threats at endpoints 
(like computers, laptops, and servers). 
It involves monitoring endpoint activities, identifying potential threats, 
and providing tools to respond to those threats quickly.
