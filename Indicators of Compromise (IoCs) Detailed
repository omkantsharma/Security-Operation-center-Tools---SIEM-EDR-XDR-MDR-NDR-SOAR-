Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) are signs of a security breach, and 
examples include ---
- malicious malware hashes like SHA256:  1234567890abcdef, 
- a suspicious IP address 192.168.1.100, 
- a phishing URL malicious.site.com, 
- a malicious file name evil.exe, 
- a registry key modification HKLM\Software\Malware, 
- unusual network traffic patterns, and 
- behavioral indicators like a sudden spike in outbound traffic. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here's a breakdown of each IoC type:

1. Malware Hashes:
What it is: A unique fingerprint (hash) of a file, used to identify malware. 
Example: SHA256: 1234567890abcdef 
Why it's important: Security tools can compare hashes of files against 
known malware databases to detect malicious activity. 

2. IP Addresses:
What it is: A numerical address assigned to devices on a network, 
potentially used for command-and-control (C2) communication
 by attackers.
Example: 192.168.1.100
Why it's important: Monitoring IP addresses for suspicious 
activity can help detect and block malicious communications. 

3. URLs:
What it is: The address of a website or web resource, 
often used in phishing attacks or to host malicious content.
Example: malicious.site.com
Why it's important: Identifying and blocking malicious 
URLs can prevent users from accessing dangerous sites. 

4. File Names:
What it is: The name of a file, which can be used to identify 
malicious software or documents.
Example: evil.exe
Why it's important: Monitoring file names can help detect 
the presence of malicious files on a system. 

5. Registry Keys:
What it is: A location in the Windows registry where software 
settings are stored, which can be modified by malware to persist on a system.
Example: HKLM\Software\Malware
Why it's important: Monitoring registry key modifications 
can help detect malware installation or persistence. 

6. Network Traffic:
What it is: Data transmitted across a network, which can 
be analyzed for suspicious patterns.
Example: A sudden spike in outbound traffic to a known 
malicious IP address.
Why it's important: Analyzing network traffic can help detect 
command-and-control (C2) communication, data exfiltration, 
or other malicious activities. 

7. Behavioral Indicators:
What it is: Unusual activity on a system or network, such as
 failed login attempts, unexpected process creation, or changes 
in system behavior.
Example: A large number of failed login attempts from a single IP address.
Why it's important: Identifying and investigating behavioral 
indicators can help detect and respond to security incidents.
