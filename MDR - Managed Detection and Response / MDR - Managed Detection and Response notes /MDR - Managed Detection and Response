Managed Detection and Response (MDR) for SOC Analysts
This guide focuses on MDR from the perspective of a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst, emphasizing tools, processes, types, and responsibilities. SOC analysts are central to MDR operations, providing expertise in monitoring, threat detection, and response.

Role of SOC Analysts in MDR
SOC Analysts are responsible for:

Monitoring: Continuously reviewing logs, alerts, and telemetry data for suspicious activities.
Analysis: Investigating alerts and determining their legitimacy (true positives vs. false positives).
Threat Hunting: Proactively searching for threats that bypass automated detection.
Incident Response: Mitigating threats through containment, eradication, and recovery.
Reporting: Creating detailed incident and performance reports.
Components of MDR Relevant to SOC Analysts
Detection

Monitoring tools (e.g., SIEM, EDR, NDR) aggregate and analyze data.
SOC analysts interpret outputs, correlate data, and prioritize incidents.
Analysis

Threat intelligence provides context for alerts.
Analysts investigate anomalies to determine the root cause and threat vector.
Response

SOC analysts execute predefined playbooks or manual responses for threat containment.
Actions may include endpoint isolation, firewall adjustments, or threat eradication.
Documentation

All activities are logged for audits, compliance, and learning.
