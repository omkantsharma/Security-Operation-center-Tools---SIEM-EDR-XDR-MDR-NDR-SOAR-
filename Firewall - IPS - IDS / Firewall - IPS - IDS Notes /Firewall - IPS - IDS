Firewalls, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS), and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), along with free and paid tools available for each category.

1. Firewall
A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

Types of Firewalls
Packet-filtering Firewall: Analyzes packets and blocks or allows based on rules.
Stateful Inspection Firewall: Tracks the state of active connections.
Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW): Incorporates features like application awareness, deep packet inspection (DPI), and IPS/IDS.
