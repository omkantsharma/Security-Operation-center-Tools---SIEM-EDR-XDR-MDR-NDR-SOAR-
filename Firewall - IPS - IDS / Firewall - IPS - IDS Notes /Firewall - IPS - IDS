------------------------------------------------------
======================================================
------------------------------------------------------
2.
Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
Definition:
A security tool that detects and alerts administrators about suspicious or malicious activities but does not block them.
Functionality:

Passive system: Monitors traffic, logs data, and sends alerts.
Focuses on detection of intrusions after they occur.
------------

Types of IDS:
---------------------

Host-Based IDS (HIDS):
Monitors activities on a specific host or device.
Example Tools:
OSSEC: Log-based HIDS.

----------------------------------------------
==============================================
----------------------------------------------
3.
Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)
Definition:
A security tool that detects and blocks malicious activities in real time.
Functionality:
Active system: Detects and mitigates threats immediately.
Positioned inline with network traffic to prevent attacks as they occur.
-------------

Types of IPS:
----------------------

Host-Based IPS (HIPS):
Protects individual hosts by monitoring activities and preventing threats.
Example Tools:
Symantec Endpoint Protection.
Trend Micro Apex One.
---------------------------

Network-Based IPS (NIPS):
Monitors and blocks malicious traffic across the network.
Example Tools:
Cisco Firepower.

------------------------

Wireless IPS (WIPS):
Secures wireless networks from unauthorized access and attacks.
Example Tools:
AirMagnet Enterprise.
WatchGuard WIPS.
----------------

Cloud-Based IPS:
Provides IPS functionality in cloud environments.
Example Tools:
AWS Shield.
Azure WAF.
