Differences between in event and flows , event coming from which devices and flows coming
from which devices in Qradar
In QRadar SIEM, events and flows are two distinct types of data that are processed, but
they serve different purposes and originate from different sources. Let's go over the key
differences between events and flows, and where each of them comes from in the context of
QRadar.
Difference between Events and Flows in QRadar
1. Events
 Definition:
Events in QRadar are discrete log entries or records generated by devices such as
firewalls, servers, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and other security tools. They
typically represent individual actions or occurrences, like a login attempt, a failed
authentication, a network connection, or a security alert.
 Characteristics:
o Time-stamped, one-time occurrences.
o Contain detailed information about the activity, such as user actions, error
messages, or security-related events.
o Can be part of security incidents that need to be investigated.
o Size: Generally smaller than flows as they contain specific information about
an event (e.g., login attempt, system error).
 Examples of Events:
o Firewall logs (blocked connection, allowed traffic)
o Intrusion detection logs (malicious activity detected)
o Login and logout attempts
o Antivirus or EDR alerts
2. Flows
 Definition:
Flows in QRadar represent a series of network connections between devices, typically
capturing details about network traffic over a period of time. A flow records
information about the source and destination IP addresses, ports, protocols, and the
volume of traffic between them.
 Characteristics:
o Continuous data streams over time.
o Represent on going network communications.
o They aggregate multiple packets into a single record that contains a summary
of the communication.
o Size: Typically larger than events because they aggregate multiple packets and
flow information.
 Examples of Flows:
o Network traffic between a server and a client (source and destination IP, ports,
etc.)
o Communication between devices or systems over time (e.g., a sustained data
transfer)
o Bandwidth usage across network segments
Where Events and Flows Come From in QRadar
Events:
Events typically come from security devices, servers, and applications that log specific
activities. Some of the most common sources of events in QRadar include:
1. Firewalls (e.g., Cisco ASA, Palo Alto, Fortinet)
o Logs about inbound/outbound traffic, blocked/allowed connections, rule
violations.
2. Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS, e.g., Snort, Suricata)
o Alerts about malicious activity, attacks (e.g., DDoS, SQL injection attempts).
3. Servers (Web Servers, Application Servers, Database Servers)
o Authentication logs, user activity, system events, application errors.
4. Antivirus/EDR Systems
o Alerts about detected malware, viruses, or suspicious activities on endpoints.
5. Authentication Servers (e.g., Active Directory, LDAP)
o User logins, failed login attempts, account lockouts, privilege escalations.
6. Email Servers (e.g., Microsoft Exchange)
o Logs of incoming/outgoing emails, blocked attachments, phishing attempts.
7. Web Proxies

How These Technologies Work Together
 Firewall: Acts as the first line of defense, filtering incoming and outgoing traffic based on
security rules.
 IPS/IDS: These tools provide deep inspection of network traffic to detect and prevent
attacks in real-time. IPS takes action to block malicious traffic, while IDS alerts administrators
of potential threats.
 NAC: Ensures that only secure and compliant devices are allowed to access the network and
enforces policies to limit the exposure of vulnerabilities.
Together, these technologies form a comprehensive security posture that:
 Prevents unauthorized access (Firewall)
 Detects and mitigates real-time threats (IPS/IDS)
 Enforces security compliance for devices connecting to the network (NAC)
This multi-layered approach helps organizations protect their networks from a wide range of threats,
ensuring both prevention and detection mechanisms are in place.
1. Firewall Enabled
A firewall acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external
networks, such as the internet. It monitors and controls network traffic based on
predetermined security rules. The role of a firewall is to prevent unauthorized access to
systems, detect potential security threats, and ensure that only legitimate traffic is allowed.
Importance of Enabling a Firewall
 Traffic Filtering: A firewall inspects incoming and outgoing network traffic to ensure that
only legitimate, authorized traffic is allowed. It blocks suspicious or malicious connections,
which could pose a risk to the system.
 Prevent Unauthorized Access: Firewalls enforce access control policies to ensure that only
authorized users or devices can access network resources. This is vital for protecting
sensitive data and preventing breaches.
 Protection Against Cyber Attacks: Firewalls defend against a wide range of attacks, including
DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service), port scanning, and unauthorized access attempts.
 Network Segmentation: Firewalls can be used to create network segments, ensuring that
critical systems or sensitive data are isolated from the rest of the network, reducing the
attack surface.
 Outbound Traffic Control: In addition to filtering incoming traffic, firewalls can also monitor
and control outbound traffic, helping prevent the exfiltration of sensitive data or
communications with malicious actors.
Types of Firewalls
 Stateful Inspection Firewall: Tracks the state of active connections and determines whether
incoming traffic is part of an established connection or is an unsolicited request.
 Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFW): In addition to traditional packet filtering, NGFWs
provide deep packet inspection, intrusion prevention, application awareness, and advanced
threat protection.
 Web Application Firewalls (WAF): Specifically designed to protect web applications by
filtering and monitoring HTTP traffic to detect and block attacks like SQL injection, cross-site
scripting (XSS), and other web-based attacks.
