ðŸ”§ Core QRadar Components
Console

Web interface for managing and monitoring QRadar.

Central point for searching logs, creating rules, and viewing offenses.

Event Collector

Collects log data from various sources (e.g., firewalls, servers).

Normalizes and forwards it to the Event Processor.

Event Processor

Processes and stores event data.

Runs correlation rules to detect threats and generate offenses.

Flow Collector

Captures and processes network flow data (e.g., NetFlow, sFlow).

Helps in traffic analysis and anomaly detection.

Flow Processor

Similar to Event Processor but for flow data.

Stores, analyzes, and correlates network flows.

Data Node

Expands QRadar storage.

Useful for retaining large amounts of historical log and flow data.

App Host (optional)

Runs QRadar apps (e.g., Use Case Manager, Threat Intelligence).

Offloads processing from the console.

Each component can be on separate servers (in distributed deployments) or combined (in an all-in-one setup)
