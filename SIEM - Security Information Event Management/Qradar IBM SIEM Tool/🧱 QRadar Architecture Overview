ðŸ§± QRadar Architecture Overview
1. All-in-One Deployment
Small setups

All components (Console, Event/Flow Collector, Processor) on a single appliance.

2. Distributed Deployment (for scalability)
Divided into specialized roles:

Console

Central UI and management

Correlation, offenses, dashboards

Event Collector

Gathers and normalizes logs

Compresses and forwards to Event Processor

Flow Collector

Collects NetFlow, sFlow, etc.

Normalizes and sends to Flow Processor

Event Processor

Parses, stores, and correlates events

Triggers rules and generates offenses

Flow Processor

Analyzes, correlates, and stores flow data

Data Node (optional)

Expands storage for long-term log/flow retention

App Host (optional)

Runs QRadar extensions (apps, AI, threat intel)

ðŸ”— Communication
Internal components communicate over secure channels (e.g., SSH, TLS).

Uses PostgreSQL, Ariel DB, and Elasticsearch (for apps) internally.

ðŸ§± QRadar Architecture Overview
1. Data Collection Layer
Event Collectors: Gather log data from various sources such as firewalls, servers, and applications. They normalize and forward this data to Event Processors.

Flow Collectors: Capture network flow data (e.g., NetFlow, sFlow) and send it to Flow Processors.

2. Data Processing Layer
Event Processors: Process and store event data, apply correlation rules, and generate offenses. They also stream live data to the console for real-time analysis.

Flow Processors: Analyze and store flow data, applying correlation rules to detect network anomalies.

3. Data Storage Layer
Data Nodes: Provide scalable storage for normalized and indexed event and flow data, supporting long-term retention and historical analysis.

4. Application Layer
App Hosts: Run QRadar applications (apps) that extend functionality, such as threat intelligence integration and advanced analytics.

5. User Interface Layer
Console: The central interface for security analysts to interact with QRadar, view dashboards, investigate offenses, and manage configurations.

ðŸ”— Communication Flow
Data Collection: Event and flow data are collected from various sources.

Normalization: Collected data is normalized to a consistent format.

Processing: Data is processed to apply correlation rules and generate offenses.

Storage: Processed data is stored in Data Nodes for retention and analysis.

Analysis: Analysts use the Console to investigate offenses and manage the system.

This architecture ensures that QRadar can efficiently collect, process, and analyze security data, providing comprehensive visibility into an organization's security posture.
